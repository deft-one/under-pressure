                <p class="paragraph">Soft washing is the use of water-based, biodegradable chemicals to break down dirt, grime, molds, mildews, algae and bacteria - leaving the surface clean and sanitized. &nbsp;Soft washing does not deteriorate or damage any surface of your home like power/pressure washing often can.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Every driveway / patio is pre-treated and post-treated if you want it to be cleaned effectively. &nbsp;It is important to hire a professional pressure washing service. &nbsp;Under Pressure Exterior Cleaning & Restoration will go above and beyond for your concrete / patio / deck pressure washing and all other exterior cleaning needs.</p>

                <img class="service-img" src="images/roofs.png" alt="">
                <p class="paragraph">When you decide to clean your roof, it is absolutely imperative that you choose a soft washing contractor. &nbsp;Traditional power washing can blast away shingles and cause flashing to leak. &nbsp;Even worse, it can negate any warranty that you may have on your roofing system. &nbsp;The most recommended way to clean a roof is via a soft wash method. &nbsp;We will utilize a gentle stream of water and a proprietary blend of biodegradable algaecides and detergents to lift stains from your roof and to kill algae, moss, mildew or lichen present. &nbsp;Afterwards, your roofing will be restored to its original beauty.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Homeowners know maintenance is the key to preventing costly future repairs. &nbsp;One simple way to prevent costly home repairs down the road is to keep your gutters and downspouts free of debris. &nbsp;We also offer removal of streaks and cleaning of the outside of the gutter for an additional cost.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Sun exposure as well as climate conditions can take a toll on your fence. &nbsp;Bring your fencing back to its initial glory with our specialized cleansing procedure, which deals with all sorts of fencing including but not limited to wood, vinyl, brick or synthetic. &nbsp;A good cleansing with the right approach will help maintain your fence quality and prevent replacing it more often.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">While lots of composite decks as well as patio brands proclaim to be “maintenance- free”, they inevitably begin to build up grime, algae and mold on the surface. &nbsp;The very same can be said for all other material used in patios and decks. &nbsp;Wash away all that grime and get your patio back to an immaculate condition so you can enjoy the outdoors.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Remove the mold, mildew, and algae that has made its home in your screened enclosure. &nbsp;Screened enclosure cleaning is time consuming and it takes a gentle, low pressure approach to safely clean them. &nbsp;The aluminum frame and screen must be sprayed from every angle to remove all the contaminants. &nbsp;If too much pressure is used, the screen can be stretched or blown out and the pool deck can chip or peel. &nbsp;We let our biodegradable cleaning detergents do the work for us. &nbsp;We can then proceed to rinse the enclosed area clean with low pressure.</p>

            <h2 class="services-h2">What is Soft Washing?</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Soft washing is a smarter and safer alternative to conventional pressure/power washing. &nbsp;Our cleansing formula established by Under Pressure Exterior Cleaning & Restoration uses water-based, eco-friendly chemicals to break down dirt and grime while also removing pest nests and webs. &nbsp;In addition, this method of exterior cleaning kills mold, mildew and algae as well as bacteria on your roofing system and other surfaces, leaving them clean and sanitized.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Soft washing eliminates microorganisms that trigger tarnishing while power/pressure washing simply cleans off the surface layer. &nbsp;Furthermore, unlike pressure/power washing, soft washing solutions are applied at pressures not much more than a standard garden hose, greatly reducing any chances of damage caused by pressure.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">If you're looking for a way to get rid of what’s growing on the surfaces around your home or business, break the cycle of constant pressure/power washing and make use of a cleaning option that treats the issues like a pest and not a stain. &nbsp;Then soft washing is just what you have been looking for.</p>
